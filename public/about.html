<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eric Lee Osorio. I have worked in IT for over 25 years. Throughout my career, 
  I have worked with many different technologies in the operational and systems architecture side of IT. 
  From setting up networks local and remote, to setting up servers and storage and backup solutions both
  locally and in the cloud, to providing support to end users, reviewing and implementing security policies,
  and everything in between to keep digital information flowing smoothly into, out of and within an organization.</p>
</p>

<p>I am currently expanding my skills into data science: AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning,
web development, blockchain and Decentralized Apps. This portfolio is my way of documenting my journey as I expand my skill set
and integrate my prior experience with my new skills in order to be able to contribute, even if in a small way, to the
creation of technical solutions to current challenges in society today. Although not all issues in society will have complete 
technical solutions, I believe that all current challenges in society can benefit from technological approaches that can often
lead to innovative solutions. </p>

<p>As I write this in the latter half of 2024, there is much talk about the hidden dangers of AI and its role in shaping 
  society. Education and industries are already being impacted by AI and other technologies. "The future is now" is not
  just a cliche anymore, but our current technological reality. Data, information and knowledge are no longer enough to keep up
  with the pace of change. We have reached a point where data and information are readily available to anyone who cares to
  look for them  and access them and much of all this data and information has been analyzed and grouped into silos of knowledge that 
  are accessible to anyone with a device capable of an internet connection. AI has accelerated our abilty to access and analyze
  data and information and to derive knowledge from it. The challenge now is to be able to discern the usefulness of all this
  knowledge in order to be able to derive wisdom from it. Wisdom, being the ability to make sound judgements and decisions
  based on knowledge and experience. In this sense, the future is not just about technology, but about the ability for us 
  humans to use technology to make sound judgements and take better decisions that will make the world a better place for 
  all of us and our future generations. </p>
